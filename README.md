# GTA Style SWEP Spawns
IMPORTANT: This addon only works in multiplayer (either local/dedicated servers or peer-peer).
If there is demand I will look into a singleplayer version.

HOW TO USE:
1. Spawn 'SWEP Spawn' entity from entities menu
2. Move the entity to the position you want
3. Use the entity (default: E) to edit it (Admin only)
4. Press 'Change weapon' to select the desired SWEP
5. Enter desired respawn time
6. Press 'Save' to add it to the database. It will now spawn on map start.
